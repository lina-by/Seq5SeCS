Language Identification is an essential aspect of almost every Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline. However, this task appears to be extremely fastidious when it comes to rarer languages, for which obtaining a clear and unbiased dataset is particularly difficult. This work compares the performance and computational cost of different methods for language identification
